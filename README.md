typing in the simraitswe script for the simtokeri language

## How to type
Use the english equivalents of the characters. Use upper case characters for modification

Stuff to remember:

- x is another way to enter a spacebar

- q is the glottal stop (') letter

- X is the wait letter (–)

- capital letters of vowels give their longer form (for example typing A enters ā)

- T is th, D, is dh, S is sh, N is ng and K is nk

- no spaces after punctuation marks
